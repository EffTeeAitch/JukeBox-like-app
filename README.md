# JukeBox-like-app
Console app imitating jukebox

App is a basic model of a jukebox that unfortunately CAN'T play actual song, instead displays its title.

App has the basic functionality of jukebox, you can: 
    - show avaliable albums that already has been inserted into jukebox
    - add you own album in the jukebox 
    - pick album to play music from 
    - skip song if you don't like it
    - stop listening to an album
    - exit (very useful) :D
