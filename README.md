# JukeBox-like-app
Console app imitating jukebox

App is a basic model of a jukebox that unfortunately _CAN'T_ play actual song, instead displays its title.

App has the basic functionality, you can: 
```
    - show avaliable albums that already has been inserted into jukebox
    - add you own album in the jukebox 
    - pick album to play music from 
    - skip song if you don't like it
    - stop listening to an album
    - exit (very useful) :D 
```
